For text draw, font family and font size are customizable and can also apply _italic_ and **bold**. Using text draw, unicode emojis can also be drawn in canvas.

By default, all the shapes are drawn with `stroke` without fill, but the `fill` option can be selected and fill can applied in rectangles, circles, ellipse, triangles, and text shapes.
